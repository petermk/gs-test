Since we are showing EQUALS, GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, GREATER THAN EQUALS, LESS THAN EQUALS, for 17, 18 and 19, you don’t need three different UI parameters. You’ll only have Number of Recipients. 
17)	Exact Number of Recipients – 4      
18)	Min Number of Recipients -- 1
19)	Max Number of Recipients – 8

Same as above. You’ll only have Number of External Recipients as the parameter.
20)	Exact Number of External Recipients -- 2
21)	Min Number of External Recipients -- 1
22)	Max Number of External Recipients – 3

23)	Is Sender External – true, false
24)	Attachment Name – hello_world, hello world
25)	Attachment Name Contains – hello_world, hello world
26)	Attachment Extension – ppt, xlsx, doc, docx
27)	Attachment Extension Contains – ppt, xlsx, doc, docx

Again, same as the other cases. You’ll only have Number of Attachments. Note that since we only have Minimum and Maximum for number of attachments, we won’t show an EQUALS for number of attachments.
28)	Min Number of Attachments -- 2
29)	Max Number of Attachments – 5

Again, same as above. You’ll only have Number of Words in Any Attachment. Note that since we only have Minimum and Maximum for number of words in any attachment, we won’t show EQUALS for number of words in any attachments.
30)	Min Number of Words in Any Attachment -- 30
31)	Max Number of Words in Any Attachment -- 200


The Metadata connectors (for the drag and drop rule builder box) are:

1)	OR
2)	AND
3)	NOT – This is not required if you are providing NOT EQUALS in the operator for a given parameter


For content, there should be only one parameter I think:

1)	Phrase – hello world


The Content connectors (for the drag and drop rule builder box) are:

1)	OR
2)	AND
3)	NOT
4)	DISTANCE
5)	CNOT

for example, if someone selects Number Of External Recipients from parameter list and selects GREATER THAN EQUALS as operator and then enters the value 5 then in the UI rule to be shown it’ll become ~MinimumNumberOfExternalRecipients=5
